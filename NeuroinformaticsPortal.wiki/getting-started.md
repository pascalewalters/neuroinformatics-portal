# Getting Started with Drupal 8
This video series was very helpful: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk9MKY_ClWcPkGtOEGyLTyCO. There are many other videos on the channel that are also in helping explain fundamental Drupal concepts.

https://www.drupal.org/project/examples has many sample modules for various purposes.
