# Requirements Gathering/Analysis
The portal has the following functions:
* Provide access to electronic data capture tools
* Provide access to web-based analysis tools
* Display the Spotfire dashboard
* Have information about how to use the Neuroinformatics Platform

The audience for the portal is researchers, who have high specialized technical knowledge. They likely wouldnâ€™t be daunted by lots of information on a webpage. The portal should also be able to be accessed with CAMH Active Directory credentials. Users should be able to access the electronic data capture tools and web-based analysis tools without having to log in again. Finally, since more analysis and electronic data capture tools could be added, the layout of the portal should be extensible so that a redesign of the page does not have to be done when another tool is added.
